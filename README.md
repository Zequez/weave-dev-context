# Weave Dev Context

The end-result that I want to create with this project is to collaborate cross-happ in the whole
set of tooling for creating Weave happs. Initial proof of concept is to be able to have a repository
with a single index.html file and once loaded into the weave-dev-context it should be entirely compilable as a Weave happ and have access to basic DNAs such as Syn DNA, Generic DNA, Profiles DNA.
